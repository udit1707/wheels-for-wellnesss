## Proposed Title of the Invention 

***SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AIDING DURING MEDICAL EMERGENCY***

----

## Proposed Abstract

The proposed idea consists of an emergency-ambulance allocation and health-crisis management online ecosystem represented by a wholly automated website and a mobile application. It is scaled to serve the masses in medical crises using real-time data streaming and handling concurrent requests. The ecosystem ensures every patient seeking medical attention benefits from the “conflict-free scheduling” principle of the engine on which the proposal stands. We strive to deliver the most accurate data concerning bed availability. Our system ensures a ‘triggered alarm’ is sent to the hospitals facing a possible bed shortage, giving them an early start to prepare for any future medical crisis.

The four most prominent parameters that determine the system’s accuracy are:

* **Severity** of the **Patient’s** health situation.
* **Location** of the **ambulance available**.
* **Location** of the **nearest hospital** with a **vacant bed**.
* **Location** of the **concerned patient**.

----

## Objectives

* To create the most accurate data set that reflects real-life situations through open-source data collection. 
* To design and perform benchmarking of the machine learning and scheduling algorithms to predict the seriousness level of the patient.
* To predict the number of ambulance demands in the future, the ARIMA model will be used.
* To write robust web services and reusable endpoints that are to be triggered from the client-side application.
* Adopt a microservice based architecture to implement distributed API configuration for ML model API
* Adopt a message broker service and implement it in the system design for minimal response delay from the server side.
* To automate the ambulance allocation procedure based on availability inside the online ecosystem from both customer interfaces.

## Problems Solved

* Optimized navigation using google’s distance matrix API
* Elimination of Human Intervention in generating a pre-diagnosis patient report.
* Bed Availability Transparency is ensured as the proposed online system uses the socket standard for communication between the client and server.
* Forecast a probable bed shortage when there is a sudden rise in the number of patient admissions.
